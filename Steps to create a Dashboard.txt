Setting up Your Bike Store Database
1.	Create the database: In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), create a new database named "BikeStores".
2.	Import the data: Find the "Data" folder provided. Open each SQL file in order (create files should be run before load files). Execute the code in each file to create and fill the database tables.
3.	Create a combined view: Write a new SQL query using JOIN commands to pull the columns you want to visualize into a single view. Save this query.
